You've done it. Your resume has been optimized. You've added all the tips by using free resume scans provided.
But the recruiter can't reach out to you in an easy manner. Is that e-mail up to date on your resume?
Do you have an e-mail on your resume? 

Instead, include a link to your LinkedIn profile which is better for your e-mail privacy and will help grow your network
because recruiters will have to add you to speak with you. So even after you're done speaking with the recruiters
you'll have them in your network for future opportunities.

Also, you'll keep your e-mail private, which is an added bonus for internet privacy.
