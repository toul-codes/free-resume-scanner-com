# Use LinkedIn so Recruiters can D.M. you (plus 10 Tips to optimize your LinkedIn)

You've done it. Your resume has been optimized. You've added all the tips by using free resume scans provided.
But the recruiter can't reach out to you in an effortless manner. Although it has been standard advice for ages to include
your personal e-mail, nowadays, it better **not** too. This is because some places will **sell** your data, resulting
in an inbox full of spam and potentially Phishing attacks. A phishing attack is where a malicious actor tries
to trick you into clicking a link and entering your login information. So be safe and don't include your personal e-mail.

Instead, use LinkedIn, which has advanced cybersecurity measures in place already. If you're unsure about where to place
your LinkedIn, then have no fear. We'll show you.

## Where to Place your LinkedIn on your Resume

Here's my resume as an example. Notice that you do not need to put the full URL, e.g. `https://linkedin.com/in/toul`
instead, you may place only the `linkedin.com/in/toul`, and it'll be picked up by the ATS Scanning software.

Now that you know where to place your LinkedIn info, here are ten tips to make your LinkedIn stand out when the recruiters
view it.

### 1. Take skills assessment

LinkedIn has online tests to aid you in verifying that you have a certain level of proficiency. The tests are **free**
Like free resume scanner, the best part is once you pass the test, it'll add a badge to your profile. A massive win
because whenever a recruiter views your profile, then they'll be sure to see that you take your professional
career seriously enough to take the time to demonstrate it.

Additionally, if you have access to a [Lynda.com](https://lynda.com) account, then for every course you complete there, it'll also show
up on your profile. I did this in college for free because many universities and libraries in the U.S. have partnerships
with [Lynda.com](https://lynda.com) so that you may learn for free! And it made all the difference in getting interviews
for internships.


### 2. Request recommendations

Nothing makes a recruiter view you in a more positive light than seeing co-workers and managers give you outstanding recommendations
for your work. Sure, most companies have quarterly or yearly evaluations, but that's not good for potential
recruiters because they're not able to see those *evaluations*. So, before you move on from one company, get
at least one co-worker to write a recommendation or your boss. Often the co-worker is an easier route as they'll
often request one for themselves, which is an additional win! Writing recommendations for others will demonstrate
your writing ability as well as the ability to give praise, which is often a considerable part of working in a corporate environment
to keep morale high.

### 3. Write LinkedIn Posts

Create a post or two per month that share your knowledge and also increases your visibility.
No topic in your field of interest is too small, and often the more brief articles describing things that you might take
as being too easy are what many beginners struggle to understand. So, don't think that the audience you're
writing for is only recruiters or other professionals.

### 4. Comment on LinkedIn posts

Get into the habit of commenting on posts if you're already giving them a like. Again this will raise your visibility, and
if you write a long comment, you'll also be able to share your professional opinion. Professional opinions are another way
to stand out and be seen on LinkedIn. And being seen means more recruiter eyes on your profile, which increases
your chances of getting that `Hey, I've seen you have these skills, and I'm hiring for x and y job.`

### 5. Select a Professional Profile photo

It is worth the money to have a professional headshot. However, if you're still an undergraduate, many universities
will offer it during the year. So make sure to sign up for it if it is available.

### 6. Use your Headline for Keywords

Do not only have your current job title in your headline. Instead, use it to share more about
what you do. In fact, if you are using free resume scanner to get feedback on missing keywords, you should consider adding those
keywords in your headline if you keep seeing the same ones come up. Because that means the job position you're searching for
tends to have a particular base set of skills. Skills that recruiters will be searching for in the LinkedIn recruiters view.


### 7. Use your Summary for more Keywords

If you've already done (6.), it doesn't hurt to add those exact keywords in your profile summary because it'll increase your
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for the LinkedIn Search Engine. Additionally, use your profile to take control of your
professional journey. Share what you've done and what you want to learn/grow in. Learning and growing are two vital
areas that recruiters look for because it demonstrates that you're willing to stay sharp.

### 8. List your Skills for even more Keywords

Again, list the keywords from job descriptions within your relevant skill set if applicable.
It's a surefire way to ensure that if you've followed the advice so far, you'll show up at the top of the search results
on LinkedIn whenever a recruiter searches for a skill like `DevOps.`

### 9. If you've been Published, then share it

On your LinkedIn profile, there's a section for publications. Make sure to fill it in even if you weren't the lead on the publication.
A publication shows that you're doing cutting thought work in your field and adds further to your professionalism.


### 10. Follow Influencers in your Industry

Following influencers is a trick for staying aware of the latest trends and a secret way to grow your network.
Don't just follow the influencers. Comments on their posts and tag them in long articles you've written that you think
may be applicable. Just one share from an influencer or a comment response from them can drastically change your LinkedIn network.
And having a more extensive network will naturally lead to more interactions on your content.
