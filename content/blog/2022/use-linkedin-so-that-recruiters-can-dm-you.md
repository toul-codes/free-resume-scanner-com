# Use LinkedIn so Recruiters can DM you (plus 10 Tips to optimize your LinkedIn)

You've done it. Your resume has been optimized. You've added all the tips by using free resume scans provided.
But the recruiter can't reach out to you in an easy manner. Although, it has been common advice for ages to include
your personal e-mail, nowadays, it better **not** too. This is because some places will **sell** your data which results
in an inbox full of spam and potentially Phishing attacks. A phishing attack is the sort where a malicious actor attempts 
to trick you into clicking a link and entering your login information. So be safe and don't include your personal e-mail.

Instead, use LinkedIn which has advanced cybersecurity measures in place already. If you're unsure about where to place
your LinkedIn then have no fear we'll show you.

## Where to Place your LinkedIn on your Resume

Here's my resume as an example. Notice that you do not need to put the full URL, e.g. `https://linkedin.com/in/toul`
instead you may place only the `linkedin.com/in/toul` and it'll be picked up by the ATS Scanning software.

Now that you know where to place your LinkedIn info here's ten tips to make your LinkedIn stand out for when the recruiters
view it.

### 1. Take skills assessment

LinkedIn has online tests to aid you in verifying that you have a certain level of proficiency. The tests are **free**
just like free resume scanner is, and the best part is once you pass the test it'll add a badge to your profile. A huge win 
because whenever a recruiter views your profile then they'll be certain to see that you take your professional 
career seriously enough to take the time to demonstrate it. 

Additionally, if you have access a [Lynda.com](https://lynda.com) account then for every course that you complete on there then it'll also show 
up on your profile. I did this while in college for free because many universities and libraries in the U.S. have partnerships
with [Lynda.com](https://lynda.com) so that you may learn for free! And it made all the difference in getting interviews 
for internships.


### 2. Request recommendations

Nothing makes a recruiter view you in a more positive light than seeing co-workers and managers give you outstanding recommendations 
for the work that you do. Sure, most companies have quarterly or yearly evaluations but that's no good to potential 
recruiters because they're not able to see those *evaluations*. So, before you move on from one company make sure to get 
at least a co-worker to write a recommendation or your boss. Many times the co-worker is an easier route as they'll
often request one for themselves as well, which is an additional win! Writing recommendation for others will demonstrate 
your writing ability as well as the ability to give praise, which is often a huge part of working in a corporate environment 
to keep morale high.

### 3. Write LinkedIn Posts

Create a post or two per month that share your knowledge and also increase your visibility.
No topic in your field of interest is too small and often times the simpler articles describing things that you might take
as being too easy are exactly what many beginners are struggling to understand. So, don't think that your audience you're
writing for is only for recruiters or other professionals. 

### 4. Comment on LinkedIn posts

Get into the habit of commenting on posts if you're already giving them a like. Again this will raise your visibility and 
if you write a long comment then you'll also be able to share your professional opinion. Professional opinions are another way
that you can stand out and be seen on LinkedIn. And being seen means more recruiter eyes on your profile, which increases 
your chances of getting that `Hey, I've seen you have these skills and I'm hiring for x and y job`

### 5. Select a Professional Profile photo

It is worth the money to have a professional headshot. However, if you're still in your undergraduate then many universities
will offer it during the year. So make sure to sign up for it if it is available. If you're already a professional then 
think of it as an investment in your personal brand. 

### 6. Use your Headline for Keywords 

Do not only have your current job title in your headline. Instead, use it as an opportunity to share a little bit more about 
what you do. In fact if you are using free resume scanner to get feedback on missing keywords then you should consider adding those
keywords in your headline if you keep seeing the same ones come up. Because that means for the job position you're searching for 
tends to have a certain base set of skills. Skills that recruiters will be searching for in the LinkeIn recruiters view.


### 7. Use your Summary for more Keywords

If you've already done (6.) it doesn't hurt to add those same keywords in your profile summary because it'll increase your 
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for the LinkedIn Search Engine. Additionally, use your profile to take control of your 
professional journey. Share what you've done and what you're wanting to learn / grow in. Learning and growing are two vital
areas that recruiters look for because it demonstrates that you're willing to stay sharp.

### 8. List your Skills for even more Keywords

Again, list the keywords from job descriptions within your relevant skill set if applicable.
It's a surefire way to make sure that if you've followed the advice so far that you'll show up at th top of the search results
on LinkedIn whenever a recruiter searches for a skill like `DevOps`.

### 9. If you've been Published then share it

On your LinkedIn profile there's a section for publications. Make sure to fill it in even if you weren't the lead on the publication.
A publication shows that you're doing cutting thought work in your field and adds further to your professionalism.


### 10. Follow Influencers in your Industry

Following influencers is a trick for staying aware of the latest trends as well as a secret way to grow your network.
Don't just follow the influencers. Comments on their posts and tag them in long articles that you've written that you think 
may be applicable.  Just one share from an influencer or comment response from them can drastically change your LinkedIn network.
And having a bigger network will naturally lead to more interactions on your content.
