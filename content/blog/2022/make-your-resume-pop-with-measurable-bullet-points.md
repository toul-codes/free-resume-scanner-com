# Make your Resume Pop with Measurable Bullet Points

## 1.a Technical Resume without measurable experience

A typical resume might look like this
```yaml
Job Applicant
-------------
linkedin.com/in/job-applicant-name

---------
History
---------
Evil Corp, Inc.
Senior Dev..................2015-present
- Increased page load times
- Optimized memory utilization 
- Removed bugs 
```

It shows the work experience and lists things done while working there. This is the standard way of listing accomplishments
while working in corporate America. And is even the advice shared by many college career service centers. The advice isn't
necessarily bad. However, it is dated. Before, you weren't submitting your resume online to Applicant Tracking Software (ATS).
ATS Scanners are commonly used for all job positions nowadays, and they operate off of an algorithm that looks for bullet
points are written in such a way as to show a `measurable` experience.

## 1.b Technical Resume with measurable experience

A resume with measurable bullet points will look like this

```yaml
Job Applicant
-------------
linkedin.com/in/job-applicant-name

---------
History
---------
Evil Corp, Inc.
Senior Dev..................2015-present
- Increased page loads by 33% in 1 month by refactoring css.styles file
- Increased algorithm performance by 2% by unnesting 3 for loops
- Identified 20 security bugs and removed them within 4 months in 2 sprint intervals
while doing feature work
```

And have a much greater chance of getting past the ats scanners used by firms.

## 2. The formula

As you might be able to tell, the general idea is to add concrete numbers to your statements in ways that make sense. This
is exactly what we're doing with the free resume scanner. If it still doesn't make sense, then try using this formula to get
you started with your bullet points.

```yaml
Accomplished [x] as measured by [y], by doing [z]
```

Let's try another example.

## 3.a Non-Technical Resume without Measurables

Here's the resume of someone who might be working as a social media marketer.

```yaml 
Job Applicant
-------------
linkedin.com/in/job-applicant-name

---------
History
---------
Evil Corp, Inc.
Senior Social Media Marketer..................2015-present
- Got more followers on social media
- Got more interactions with followers
- Made posts 
```

## 3.b Non-Technical Resume with Measurables

Now, let's use the formula to spruce up the resume so that it'll knock the socks of the ats scanner whenever it passes through.

```yaml 
Job Applicant
-------------
linkedin.com/in/job-applicant-name
---------
History
---------
Evil Corp, Inc.
Senior Social Media Marketer..................2015-present
- Accomplished adding 30k followers on Instagram as measured by follower count from 1st quarter of 2022
vs. fourth quarter of 2022
- Accomplished adding 1000% more social interactions on Instagram as shown by Instagram analytics for YTD
- Accomplished creating a regular posting schedule over 12 months, increasing the number of posts to 24 for the YTD
```

### Conclusion
