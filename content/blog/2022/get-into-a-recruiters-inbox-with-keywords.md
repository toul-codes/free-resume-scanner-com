# Get into a Recruiter's Inbox with Keywords with these 5 Tips!

Keywords are the hidden secret to getting seen by Recruiters. As you apply to job postings, your resume is scanned
by Applicant Tracking Software (ATS), which uses keyword filters to determine whether your resume comes up
in search results that the recruiters see. If you want to beat the online ats scanner used by most companies today, keep reading.

## How to find Keywords

Once you submit your resume and the job description that you're applying to the Free Resume Scanner, then you'll receive a
list what keywords are missing from your resume compared to what's found in the job description.
Simply try your best to add as many of the keywords as possible in a natural way to your resume, and you'll drastically
increase the likelihood of it getting past the online ats scanners and into a recruiter's inbox.

Still confused? Don't worry. Here are our five tips for adding keywords to your resume naturally.

## 1. Resume Introduction
While introducing yourself, give a brief sentence explaining what you're an expert at.

Here's an example.

```yaml
Job App 
------
linkedin.com/in/job-app
------
Intro
------
Good day, I'm Job App, and I'm most experienced with Adobe, SQL, Data Analytics, and GoLang. I think I'm the ideal candidate. 
```

## 2. Work history

This is where you'll most likely be able to stuff the most keywords in. It is okay if the keywords repeat, as this will add strength to your resume to beat the ats scanner. However, try not to let it repeat more than 3 times.

## 3. Related Skills section

Every a resume should have a skills section just to do well when scanned by the ats. Here's an example

Example
```yaml
Job App 
------
linkedin.com/in/job-app
------
Intro
------
Good day, I'm Job App, and I'm most experienced with Adobe, SQL, Data Analytics, and GoLang. I think I'm the ideal candidate. 
----------------
Relevant Skills 
---------------
- SQL
- Java
- JavaScript
- Power BI
```

## 4. Education and Training

If you've taken an online course or a class in college that's relevant to the position, then use it to boost your keywords.

Example
```yaml
Job App 
------
linkedin.com/in/job-app
------
Intro
------
Good day, I'm Job App, and I'm most experienced with Adobe, SQL, Data Analytics, and GoLang. I think I'm the ideal candidate. 
----------------
Relevant Skills 
---------------
- SQL
- Java
- JavaScript
- Power BI
-------------
Training 
-------------
- Machine Learning with Python 2100 on Lynda.com
- Excel Pro course on Udemy
```

## 5. Cover Letter

The last hidden spot to add keywords is within your cover letter. We bet now that you'll be much more motivated to add one to your job applications.

Example
```yaml
Dear Recruiter,
I'm a job applicant, and I jumped for joy whenever I saw your posting for Data Analytics Engineer. I studied data analytics as my undergrad, where I learned about Pandas, Excel, Data Mining, and MatPlotLibs. If given a chance at Evil Corp, I'll be able to utilize my skills to increase train the machine learning models to be more accurate.

Sincerely,

Job App
