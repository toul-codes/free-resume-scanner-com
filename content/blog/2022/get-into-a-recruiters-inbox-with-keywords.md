# Get into a Recruiter's Inbox with Keywords

Keywords are the hidden secret to getting seen by Recruiters. As you apply to job postings your resume is being scanned 
by Applicant Tracking Software, which uses a keyword filters to determine whether your resume comes up 
in search results that the recruiters see. 

So, add the keywords provided with your free resume scan, and you'll 
drastically increase your chances of being read rather than left on seen.
