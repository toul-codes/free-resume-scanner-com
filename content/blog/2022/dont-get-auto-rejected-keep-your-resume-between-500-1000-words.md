# Don't get auto-rejected keep your resume between 500 and 1000 words

The ideal resume length is 500 words to 1000 words. No more and no less. If you do not keep your resume 
within those boundaries then it probably will not make it through the Applicant Tracking Software and will 
end up in the trash.
