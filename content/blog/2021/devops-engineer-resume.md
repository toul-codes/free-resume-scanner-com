In this post I provide my DevOps Engineer Resume as an example, and the tool I wield to make it competitive when applying to jobs.
<!-- Excerpt End -->

DevOps is a challenging field to get into and as a consequence it is even more challenging finding DevOps Engineers in most folk's
immediate network. In fact, I had never met a DevOps Engineer until my internship in college. Let alone seen a DevOps Engineer Resume.
So, I'm here to show what my resume looks like as a DevOps or DevSecOps engineer, what it looked like in internships, and
what it looked like to get an internship.

## Current DevOps Engineer Resume

I use a plain text style resume when applying online to jobs because of the Applicant Tracking System (ATS), which is a piece
of software that scans most people's resumes whenever they apply online. It is not the best piece of software in the world
and often *fancier* resumes with formatting and spacing do **not** get properly read. So, I recommend the use of a plain
text resume for applying online and then provide a *fancier* resume upon request (recruiter messages on LinkedIn or before
interviews).

Additionally, I also use [Free Resume Scanner](https://freeresumescanner.filipinodev.co), a web application that I've opened up to my readers for FREE
that I use on my resume when applying for different job postings. It's a simple tool that tells you want the recruiters
are looking for based upon the posting and provides actionable feedback.

Anyways, here is my current basic resume that is geared towards Security which is what I'm interested in (currently studying
for AWS Security Certification Exam and then CISSP).

## Student DevOps Engineer Resume

Probably, the most interesting resume to those in college. An important similarity between this one and my current
DevOps Engineer Resume is that it opens with a section of side projects. Side projects are an important thing in the IT world
as they help you to keep up with current technologies and make you more competitive than the next applicant. Notice, each of
the projects is a full-stack project with different technologies. I also had live links to 1 or 2 of the projects
so that a recruiter could easily check it out or interviewer and ask me questions about it.
