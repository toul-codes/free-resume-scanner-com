# About 

Hi, I'm [Toul](https://toul.io) founder of Free Resume Scanner, and it is a pleasure to meet you.

Like you, I've been there where you're applying for hundreds of jobs to only receive the dreaded, automated e-mail response
below:

```yaml
Dear Toul, thank you for applying for the role but we've decided to move on with another candidate.
Sincerely, 
Mega Corp HR
```

That automated e-mail frustrated me to no end. So, I spent hundreds of hours researching why my Resume wasn't working and 
figured out it was because of the Applicant Tracking Software (ATS). The ATS is software that scans your resume and 
determines whether it gets seen by human eyes. 

After, learning this I figured out all the hidden secrets the software uses 
to scan your resume to determine its fate. Those, ATS Scanner Secrets are what make up the sophisticated algorithm that 
powers FreeResumeScanner.com. 

In fact, I've been approached by several fortune 500 companies to acquire the code
but have declined each time. I don't believe that job-seekers should have to pay tens to hundreds of dollars a month 
to get ats scanning software feedback. Especially, job-seekers like me who were first generation college students with 
immigrant parents that can't afford the fees.

So, I've used my professional software engineering skills and countless hours to make FreeResumeScanner.com **FREE**. Use
it as much as you need to get that life changing interview.


Sincerely,

Toul
